        <p>I am a fun, life-loving mom and wife. I love to spend my free time adventuring with my two little girls and husband. We
          love to travel, and I plan to put as many checks on my bucket list as I can! I am as girly as it gets and love
          all things pink or sparkly. When I am not traveling, I spend my time either doing aerial fitness, or coding. I
          started at a young age doing circus classes (trapeze, ballet, gymnastics, lyra- you name it!), and continue to
          take aerial classes (mostly pole and silks these days). Aerial work keep me physically in shape, and coding
          keeps me mentally sharp. My interests wrap up the best of both in neat little bow! </p>
    
        <p>I started working towards a career in development because it so greatly combines my strengths and niches. I
          am able to be incredibly creative and showcase my keen eye for style and design. I am also very organized and a
          bit of a self-proclaimed perfectionist, so that only benefits me when laying out code. I enjoy all types of
          technology and always try to stay up on the latest and greatest. The best part of working in development is
          the ability to work remotely. There is nothing more enjoyable than doing your work surrounded by what you
          love- whether that be nature, or the comfort of your own home! I look forward to constantly learning new
          development tricks and putting them to use. Technology is ever changing and there is no limit to where it may
          take us, so I plan to learn all that I can and explore it to the fullest!!</p>
