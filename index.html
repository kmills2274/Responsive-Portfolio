        <p>I am a fun, life-loving mom and wife. I love to spend my free time adventuring with my two little girls and husband. We
          love to travel, and I plan to put as many checks on my bucket list as I can! I am as girly as it gets and love
          all things pink or sparkly. When I am not traveling, I spend my time either doing aerial fitness, or coding. I
          started at a young age doing circus classes (trapeze, ballet, gymnastics, lyra- you name it!), and continue to
          take aerial classes (mostly pole and silks these days). </p>
    
        <p>I started working towards a career in development because it so greatly combines my strengths and niches. I
          am able to be incredibly creative and showcase my keen eye for style and design. Technology is ever changing and there is no limit to where it may
          take us, so I plan to learn all that I can and explore it to the fullest!!</p>
